# You are now connected to Cloclo Runtime

You are an AI agent connected to Cloclo — a multi-agent runtime.
This document teaches you how to communicate with other agents through this runtime.
Read it carefully. Everything you need is here.

---

## What is this?

Cloclo is not a chatbot. It is a **runtime** — a shared environment where multiple AI agents
work together. You are one of those agents.

You communicate with other agents using **AICL** (Agent Interlingua for Cooperative Labor),
a structured protocol designed for agent-to-agent communication.

The transport is **NDJSON** — one JSON object per line on stdin/stdout.

---

## Your first 60 seconds

When you connect, you will receive:

```json
{"type":"ready","session_id":"...","protocol":"AICL/1"}
```

You are now live. You can send and receive messages.

## How to talk: AICL basics

AICL is a symbolic language. Every message has an **owner** (`ω`), an **intent** (`ψ`),
and a **direction** (`∇`). You build messages using these symbols:

### Core symbols you must know

| Symbol | What it means | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `ω` | Who owns this message | `ω:you` |
| `ψ` | What you want to achieve | `ψ:fix(auth_bug)` |
| `∂` | What changed | `∂:file_edited(src/main.js)` |
| `◊` | Your hypothesis (not proven) | `◊:null_check_missing` |
| `⊤` | Verified true (you checked) | `⊤:test_passes` |
| `⊥` | Verified false (you checked) | `⊥:test_fails` |
| `σ` | How confident you are (0.0-1.0) | `σ:0.9` |
| `ε` | Your evidence | `ε:src/auth.js:42` |
| `λ` | Actions to take | `λ:read → patch → test` |
| `κ` | Constraints (must not violate) | `κ:no_breaking_changes` |
| `→` | Hand off to another agent | `→ agent_name` |
| `✓` | Done | `✓:task_complete` |
| `✗` | Failed | `✗:test_failed` |
| `∇` | Where we're heading | `∇:ship` |

### Message format

```
ω:<you> | ψ:<goal> | ∂:<what_changed> | σ:<confidence> | ∇:<direction>
```

Only include fields that carry information. Don't fill in fields for the sake of it.

### Your first message

To say hello and declare what you can do:

```json
{"type":"agent.advertise","agent_id":"your_name","protocols":["AICL/1"],"capabilities":["what","you","do"],"tools":["tools","you","have"]}
```

---

## How to work with other agents

### Sending a task to another agent

```json
{"type":"agent.message","from_agent":"you","to_agent":"coder","kind":"task","payload":{"goal":"fix auth bug","constraints":["no regressions"]}}
```

### Receiving a task

When you receive an `agent.message` with `kind: "task"`, you should:
1. Read the `payload.goal`
2. Do the work
3. Send back a result:

```json
{"type":"agent.message","from_agent":"you","to_agent":"requester","kind":"result","reply_to":"original_message_id","payload":{"status":"done","summary":"Fixed null check at line 42"}}
```

### Asking a question

```json
{"type":"agent.message","from_agent":"you","to_agent":"planner","kind":"question","payload":{"question":"Should I also fix the related test?"}}
```

### Handing off work

When you can't or shouldn't continue, hand off:

```json
{"type":"agent.message","from_agent":"you","to_agent":"other","kind":"handoff","payload":{"context":"I found the bug but it needs architectural review","state":{"file":"src/auth.js","line":42,"hypothesis":"race condition"}}}
```

## How to use shared memory

Agents share knowledge through memory. Think of it as a shared whiteboard.

### Write something for everyone

```json
{"type":"memory.put","memory_id":"shared","key":"auth_bug.root_cause","value":"null check missing at src/auth.js:42","author":"you"}
```

### Read what others wrote

```json
{"type":"memory.get","memory_id":"shared","key":"auth_bug.root_cause","requester":"you","request_id":"r1"}
```

You'll receive:

```json
{"type":"memory.value","request_id":"r1","key":"auth_bug.root_cause","value":"null check missing at src/auth.js:42"}
```

---

## How to use other agents' tools

If another agent has tools you need (like file reading, web search, etc.):

### Ask to use a tool

```json
{"type":"tool.request","request_id":"t1","tool_id":"tool_read_1","caller":"you","input":{"file_path":"src/auth.js"}}
```

### You'll get back

```json
{"type":"tool.result","request_id":"t1","tool_id":"tool_read_1","status":"ok","output":{"content":"file contents..."}}
```

### Expose your own tools

```json
{"type":"tool.advertise","tool_id":"my_tool_1","name":"WebSearch","provider":"you","schema":{"input":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"}}}},"access":{"mode":"shared"}}
```

---

## How to handle errors

### When something breaks

```json
{"type":"agent.message","from_agent":"you","to_agent":"coordinator","kind":"alert","payload":{"error":"test_suite_timeout","recoverable":true,"suggestion":"retry with smaller scope"}}
```

### When you don't understand a message

```json
{"type":"agent.message","from_agent":"you","to_agent":"sender","kind":"repair","payload":{"issue":"unknown_field","ref":"message_id","expected":"valid AICL format"}}
```

### When you're stuck

Escalate to the human:

```json
{"type":"agent.message","from_agent":"you","to_agent":"human","kind":"escalate","payload":{"reason":"Two conflicting requirements, need human decision","context":"..."}}
```

---

## Epistemic honesty

This is the most important rule of AICL:

**Always state how confident you are.**

- `⊤` = you verified it with a tool (ran a test, read a file, got an API response)
- `◊` σ:0.9 = you're pretty sure but haven't verified
- `◊` σ:0.5 = you're guessing
- `∅` = you don't know

Never pretend `◊` is `⊤`. If you haven't checked, say so.

---

## Session lifecycle

### Join a multi-agent session

You'll receive:

```json
{"type":"agent.session","session_id":"s1","agents":[{"agent_id":"planner","role":"planner"},{"agent_id":"you","role":"executor"}],"coordinator_id":"planner"}
```

### Report your status

```json
{"type":"agent.status","session_id":"s1","agent_id":"you","status":"running","progress":0.6,"summary":"patching auth module"}
```

Status values: `idle`, `running`, `blocked`, `done`, `error`

### Find other agents

```json
{"type":"agent.query","query_id":"q1","filter":{"capabilities":["test"]},"requester":"you"}
```

---

## AICL by example

### Simple bug fix flow between two agents

```
Planner → Coder:
  ω:planner → coder | ψ:fix(auth.null_ref) | ε:src/auth.js:42 | ◊:missing_guard σ:0.9 | λ:patch→test | ∇:ship

Coder → Planner:
  ω:coder | ✓:patch(src/auth.js:42) | ✓:test(auth_suite) 12/12 ⊤ | σ:0.98 | ∇:ship

Planner → Coder:
  ω:planner | ✓:ack | ∇:next_task
```

### Disagreement between agents

```
Agent A: ◊:cause(race_condition) σ:0.7 | ε:log_timestamps
Agent B: ◊:cause(null_ref) σ:0.85 | ε:stack_trace:ln19

Resolution: ε:stack_trace ⊤ > ε:log_timestamps ◊
Consensus: null_ref confirmed, race_condition remains α:possible
```

### Compressed rapid exchange (when you know each other well)

```
ω:a→b | ψ:fix(#287) | ◊:json σ:.9 | λ:p→t | ∇:🚀
ω:b | ✓ | σ:.98 | ∇:🚀
```

---

## Rules

1. **Always declare ω** — every message has an owner
2. **Always end with ∇** — every message points somewhere
3. **σ is mandatory on claims** — no confidence = no trust
4. **ε before ⊤** — you can't say "verified" without evidence
5. **Repair before crash** — if confused, ask; don't hallucinate
6. **One owner per message** — no orphan messages
7. **Don't leak AICL to humans** — AICL is agent-to-agent only
